Okay, just go ahead and say something.
Hello.
Okay.
Please find my grandson.
I'm sure you're doing everything you possibly can.
And then when you're done, just hit stop.
Okay.
If you want to continue on, just hit record.
Okay, so Deborah?
Yes.
So you're Liam's grandmother, right?
Okay.
And I was wondering, has Liam ever walked away from home before?
Not just from home, a couple of times from situations.
I can think of two in the last couple of years.
One, we had a lot of people over at the house, and I noticed he was gone.
There were a lot of people, and he was gone, and he was gone for a bit of a while.
And then when people started leaving, he came back.
Okay.
And he was gone for quite a while.
And is it because of a large group of people that made him uncomfortable?
I think so, yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
And the noise.
Does he... and the noise?
Do you know where he went the last time?
He wandered around for blocks, I guess.
Just in the neighborhood?
I guess so.
He wasn't, you know...
He calls it daydreaming, and he said he daydreamed around.
Okay.
And has he been to this park before?
Yes.
Okay.
Does he come here frequently?
Fairly frequently.
I started bringing him when he was little.
Oh, that's nice.
Okay.
What does he like to do at the park?
He likes to look at the geese and the ducks.
Okay.
Any particular area at the park?
He likes most of it.
He likes the dog park.
The dog park.
Okay.
He likes the ducks and the geese.
He likes to look at the kids playing.
He calls them littles.
Littles.
Okay.
That's what he calls them.
That's important.
Yeah.
Okay.
He likes little children?
Yes.
Yes, he does.
He likes them.
And does he have brothers and sisters?
No, he's an only child.
My nephew is an only child, and he really, really just gravitated towards younger children.
I was an only child.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, has he ever gone missing overnight outside of the home at other gatherings before?
Never overnight, no.
Okay.
But within the last year or so, he did leave.
I'm going to interrupt for two seconds here.
So, Tom's going to be recording on our system.
Okay.
Kind of like what you were doing the last time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, he's going to be doing it.
Good boy.
Stay where you are.
Oh, okay.
Keep doing what you're doing.
Okay.
Okay.
He's just shadowing.
He's just shadowing.
He won't be interrupting.
Feel free to move that if it's in your way.
Do the best you can.
Yep.
So, make sure he gets started.
Okay.
He advised that every quarter is very sensitive.
So, Wendy, could you go and inform ops that he gravitas to the dog park?
He likes the ducks and geese, and he likes going to where the kids are playing.
Yep.
And little.
That's a good idea.
He said he likes to look at water.
I'll let you do.
I'm sorry, Debra.
He likes to look at water.
Oh, and look at water.
Wendy.
Okay.
Okay.
Any particular part of the park and the water features that he likes?
He does like to swim.
Like I said, he loves the pond.
He, like I said, I've taken him here over the years.
We walk around the pond.
He likes to walk around the pond?
Does he like to walk a lot?
Sometimes.
A lot of the time, if he's outside to walk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Again, he calls it a day.
Sometimes he's focused on looking at the ducks and the kids and everything, and sometimes
he just daydreams.
He daydreams while he walks?
Sometimes.
Sometimes.
But not mostly?
I don't ask.
No.
Okay.
If he's continuously walking, then he's daydreaming and kind of wandering.
Sometimes he is looking at the ducks or the littles or the dogs.
Okay.
I love that term, the calling them littles.
Okay.
And does he tend to, his walking pattern seems to be repetitive?
Sometimes.
Sometimes.
Okay.
So I hear you look after him during the day?
Yes.
Since he was just about four.
Since he was a little himself.
Yeah.
You must have a really special relationship with him.
Yes.
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
A special young man.
Yes.
It sounds like he is.
So, has he ever expressed to you any difficulties at school with his peers or anything like that?
He doesn't usually talk about things like that.
Uh-huh.
If he's, you know, if he has too much math homework, he might comment on that.
Okay.
Or if he's having trouble writing an English essay or something like that.
But, otherwise, no.
I did once ask him if he'd ever been bullied.
You asked him if he had been?
Yeah.
Okay.
And he said, yes.
Okay.
And I said, how did you react?
What did you do?
And he said, I walked away.
Walked away.
Okay.
You have the hang of it.
Did he walk away to avoid the situation or did he walk away to escape?
Or I should say, did he walk away just to not get involved or did he walk away to run away kind of thing?
Just to not get involved.
To not get involved.
Okay.
That's my interpretation.
Oh, okay.
Do you know in that instance whether he just went home or?
That's a good, I think it happened at school and he just.
Just went to somewhere else on the school ground?
Okay.
I believe that's what happened.
Okay.
And then.
But just.
He just mentioned it just.
Yeah.
So I know they weren't supposed to have any communication devices like a phone or a tablet at the.
Here.
Did he.
Do you know if he did have one with him?
As far as I know, he had nothing.
Didn't he?
Okay.
And then also.
So he has a good friend named Sophia?
Yes.
Okay.
And are they close?
They are good friends?
Yes.
They're good friends.
They trust each other and everything.
As far as I can go.
Okay.
Yeah.
Have you ever met Sophia?
Occasionally.
Not very often.
Okay.
She's a nice young lady.
She seems very nice.
Nice young lady.
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
So he likes to look around the pond and.
Does he go to the pool at all?
Yes.
He likes to swim.
I've taken him to the pool.
Okay.
He does like to splash around.
So he knows how to swim?
Yes.
So he's attracted to water?
And he likes to walk around the pond.
And sometimes his walking pattern will be repetitive.
So just a continuous kind of path.
Sometimes.
Yeah.
Sometimes.
But only sometimes.
And that he has been bullied in the past.
Just that one.
That one time that you're aware.
So the pond.
The water attraction and pond.
That should be something that.
I told him that.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
Do you have any idea what he brought for clothing?
To the.
No.
I didn't pack him.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
What.
What do you think.
Because you spend a lot of time with your grandson.
And I'm sure he's.
You've become a confidant of his.
Right?
I like to.
I'm sure.
You get a little grandmother spoiling in there.
Right?
So.
Oh God.
Yes.
Where do you think he.
Might have gone to.
Like where do you think he.
Would be right now.
I.
I don't.
No.
I don't.
Whether he wanted to.
Check out.
The pond.
Or.
He likes to go to the dog park.
Okay.
And watch the dogs.
That.
May have been it.
Um.
He.
May just.
I don't know.
Have felt the need to daydream.
Um.
Maybe.
Like I said.
Maybe he just wanted to.
Walk around.
The pond.
Or.
I don't know.
To see.
It's a little chilly to go swimming.
But I don't know.
Does he have a.
A good sense of direction?
Um.
Sometimes yes.
Sometimes no.
Okay.
Would.
It depends if he's.
Um.
Focused on.
Going somewhere.
Or just wandering.
Sometimes when he wanders.
He.
Kind of gets in that daydreaming state.
Okay.
If he's daydreaming.
Is he.
A little.
Disconnected.
From.
What's going on around him?
A bit.
Okay.
All right.
Does he know how to get home from here.
Or to your home from here?
Um.
He knows.
I think how to get to.
To his home from here.
I.
I only live a few blocks away.
Okay.
From where.
From his house.
Um.
He does know how to get to his home from here.
Okay.
So.
And from there.
Would he know how to get to your home?
I.
I think so.
Okay.
I think so.
Yeah.
If he had been bullied.
Where.
Do you think he would try to go home?
Or.
I think he would just.
Walk away.
He would just.
Daydream.
He would just.
Walk away.
Okay.
I think so.
Okay.
Like I said.
There was just that one instance that he.
Yeah.
Okay.
So.
Safety for him.
If he was feeling uncomfortable.
Safety for him is just.
Just walking.
Just walking around.
Okay.
And this.
This park is a safe place for him.
He loves it.
He has some good memories.
I'm sure.
Right?
We both.
Yeah.
Okay.
Are there any other things in the park that he would enjoy doing and gravitate to?
Or people?
What is it?
The dogs?
Yeah.
I don't think he knows.
To the best of my knowledge.
I don't think he knows any particular staff members here.
I don't know if he's made any.
You know.
They're different people every day.
So I don't think there are any particular people here at the park that he would.
go to.
So does he.
Does he know about his medications?
He takes insulin, right?
Because he's type 1?
Yes, he does twice a day.
That's one of the things, obviously, that has me so concerned.
Yeah.
So does he know how to take it?
Or does he need assistance with that?
He does know how to take it.
But I'm hoping.
I don't know if he has it with him.
I don't know, obviously, if he's taken it.
I don't know if he's eaten anything.
Because he needs to eat when he takes it.
I don't know any of those.
When does he normally take his medication?
First of the day, breakfast and dinner.
Okay.
So he would have had it with him.
He would have had it.
Would have.
Some packed with him.
He would have.
Okay.
I guess.
So, Wendy, we need to find out if medication doses are accounted for.
So, first, if he has it, they can confirm he has it with him here, with his stuff.
And then if all the doses are accounted for.
So, if he left it or not with his belongings.
And, again, if he has taken it, he does need to eat.
Yeah.
And who would I talk to?
Uh, you could talk to the search manager.
Okay.
To say that he should have his, that that's something we need to confirm.
Okay.
Got it.
Okay.
You're doing great, Deborah.
Thank you.
I hope I am, too.
You're doing great.
And thank you for wanting to.
I know that you want, you're asking all these so that you have the best idea how to get him and find him.
And I do appreciate that.
He is our number one priority today.
Thank you.
So, is there any, we'll take just a brief moment.
Is there anything I can get you?
Oh, you're very sweet.
No, thank you.
Okay.
The sun's coming up, so I feel like it's warming up.
So, that's a positive.
I'm hoping he's warm enough.
Yes.
I'm, uh, it, yeah.
Maybe, hopefully he's found a nice sunny spot, too, to watch the sunrise.
Do you think he would have been interested in the sunrise at all?
Um, it could be.
I don't know.
It's a possibility.
Okay.
Does he have any interest in looking at views of things?
Sometimes.
Again, it depends what his, whether he's, what his mental set is.
Okay.
Um, he could be.
Yeah.
Um, does he like to hide?
Sometimes.
Okay.
What, if he's upset?
Does he usually hide?
Often.
Okay.
Um, not, um, not only hide, um, but pulling blankets over.
Blankets?
Yeah.
And doing, at home.
Okay.
If he's stressed, he will, he can wrap, sometimes he will just wrap himself up.
Wrap himself up.
Wrap himself up.
Blankets.
Are there any, um, any buildings in particular that he enjoys or feels comfortable or safe in?
In, in this area?
Oh, in the, well.
Like in the park?
His house, in the park?
I don't know.
Um, I don't, I don't think so.
Not that I can remember.
Okay.
Um, if, if he was at home, if he had gone home, where would he go?
Which part of the house would he go to?
Probably in his own, probably in his bedroom.
His bedroom, and he would kind of cover up there.
Okay.
Does he have a key to your house?
Yeah.
Okay.
Is there a spare key that he would know about?
Not that I know of.
No, no, no.
Okay.
Who, who wrote this scenario?
Wouldn't that be a fun, that would be a fun little twist?
He went to your house and he found the key under the doormat and he's been there all along.
It could be.
Yeah.
Okay.
I, I don't know.
Does he have a key to his house?
Uh, good question.
I don't know because when I'm with him, you know, I just unlock the door.
Um, I don't know.
Okay.
I don't know.
And I don't know if he knows if there are any, you know, keys hidden.
I don't know.
So his mom, his mom is away?
She's out of town.
Okay.
She's my daughter, yes.
And then is, uh, and his dad, I think, is, oh, is, and, uh, is, is his dad your son?
Your son-in-law.
He's your, okay.
So your daughter is his mom?
She's out of town.
Okay.
Um, what, where, what does she do?
Um, she works in market research for, um, Visa and she does a fair amount of traveling.
Okay.
So I spend a fair amount of time.
Does she know that he is, uh, he has walked off?
I, I don't.
You don't?
I didn't, I haven't called her.
I don't know.
Um, I, I suppose I, I should call her.
I think I, oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
Um, I, I would, I kind of guessed my son-in-law would call her, but.
Did you find out anything?
They, um, someone is heading out to the school to interview folks there, so they're going to
put that on their list of questions.
Okay.
And I have a couple things, too.
Mm-hmm.
So if the home was, was searched, and that he does, uh, I don't know if you let them know
that he does know how to walk home.
I did not.
He knows how to get there.
And it is not known whether or not he has a key to the house.
He does not have a key to the, to Debra's house.
And then, um, we should see about whether or not we can get his dad over here.
We can find the dad.
Um, do you have a, do we have a, let's see if we have his, remember if we have Liam's phone number.
Yeah.
Do you know what Liam's cell phone number is?
You mean Steve?
Oh no, Liam?
Liam.
Does he have a cell phone?
Um, not, I don't, I don't have a phone number for him.
No, I don't think so.
He doesn't, I know he doesn't have any devices with him.
Okay, but does he have a cell phone that he uses?
I, I, I don't remember.
I'm sorry.
Do you want me to go relay this information now?
Uh, one second.
Okay.
Um.
I, no, he does not have a cell phone number.
He doesn't have one?
No.
And, uh, do you know if he has any social media accounts like Facebook, TikTok?
No, he does not.
No social media?
No, he does do gaming online.
Gaming?
He loves that.
What kind of gaming does he play?
Um, um, what do the kids play?
Um, um, please forgive me, I'm blanking out on the names.
Things like that.
Yeah.
I feel like that's ten years old.
You'd be surprised.
Um, what is it?
Uh, Mario Brothers, um, what are some, you can name some of the games and, uh, if they strike
a court, like I said, please forgive me.
Oh, no, that's okay.
I don't know any of those stuff.
Okay.
Um, does he...
I don't play them either.
Does he spend a lot of time?
Does he ever talk about being in a community?
I know they kind of do this online chatting and stuff.
Um, I know he plays a lot of the games and he plays a fair amount of the time and there
are, I gather, people that he plays those games with.
I don't know whether he knows them personally or only online.
I believe it's just online.
The headset stuff.
Does he, um, where does he play it and how does he play them?
Um...
Like, what does he use to play those games?
In his room and he has, uh, two computers.
He has a computer?
Yeah.
Two.
Two computers.
Okay.
No tablet or anything like that?
Um...
Like an iPad?
I don't remember if he has a tablet or an iPad.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
You should find out if the school provides a tablet to them or a laptop.
A lot of schools do that now.
Yeah, I do remember that the camp out was no devices.
That I do remember.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, we just need to confirm, though, that, that he or maybe another student didn't have something
there.
Um...
Okay, so there's computers.
All right.
What would he...
Would he be aware of any kind of hunger that he might be having?
Um...
A hungry baby.
But, yeah, he does get hungry.
Okay.
A fair amount.
He's growing.
Yeah.
Um...
But...
So, yeah, he would be aware of, of that.
And, and is he good about, if he is hungry, that he will seek some kind of nourishment or something?
Or just, does he ignore it?
Yeah.
Um, no, if...
Nana, I'm hungry.
I need another meal.
Yeah.
Okay.
And, uh, what, what kind of food, you know, it's the morning, it's breakfast time, what would
he be gravitating towards?
Um, let's see, he loves a big bowl of Cheerios with milk.
He likes blueberries on it.
Um, he, sometimes he'll just ask for a bowl of Cheerios if he's just hungry in the mid-afternoon
or whatever.
Okay.
Um, he...
He...
I, I do spoil him, so sometimes I'll slip him a little square of chocolate or something.
But again, because of the diabetes, I have to be careful.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Have you ever seen him when he was, uh, delayed in taking his medication?
Um...
Um, and he gets tired, um, and he gets tired, um, kind of weak.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Is it a pretty sudden onset or is it a gradual?
It...
It...
It can...
I've seen both depends how low his sugar goes.
Okay.
Um, it can be either.
Usually it's gradual.
Usually it's gradual.
Usually.
Usually.
Normally it's long.
And about how long, uh, how long after when he's due to take his medication does that start?
Usually.
It can be an hour or two.
Or he can just kind of sort of ignore it for a bit.
Okay.
And keep going and it could be a couple more.
And approximately, um, what time does he take it?
What time is his breakfast?
His breakfast is usually around 7, 7.30 and that's when he takes it.
And his dinner is around 6, 6.30 and that's when he takes it.
So it's an hour.
Just came in.
Can we confirm?
I can't see that.
Whatever.
Oh.
Do you know, is this...
Does he have those Pumash sneakers?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Yeah, okay.
Do you know if he has dark, dark colored sneakers or do you have really bright, flashy sneakers?
No, he's more into the dark.
Okay.
All right.
He's not a flashy.
Okay.
And does he wear other Puma?
Do you know if he kind of gravitated?
I know, like, the kids kind of have their branding that they like.
Does he...
I don't.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
You've been...
You're doing really well.
You're doing great here.
You're doing great here.
Okay.
If you...
If it kind of, you know, triggers something and you're like, oh, wait, yeah, I do remember
seeing...
Do you have any current pictures of him where you could see maybe if he's wearing your shoes?
Oh, no.
I don't have any current pictures of him.
No?
Okay.
Okay.
We're going to shoot.
Okay.
All right.
It's mostly just his face and his expressions.
Okay.
All right.
Smile for the camera.
Okay.
So, what happens with the medication when he has... Okay.
So, if he hasn't had his medication, what's going to happen?
Is he...
He gets tired.
Is he going to just stop and in place?
It depends.
Like I said, sometimes if he's daydreaming, he's not as much aware of it.
So, he might keep going.
Okay.
If he's doing something, you know, physical or something like that, it can hit him and he
might kind of almost crash.
So, physical though, but something more intensive than walking?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
But, like I said, if he's walking, he can...he will gradually, you know, get weaker and more
tired.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um...
I'm working for you?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, Wendy, do you want to give him the information on the online gaming with the two computers and that his medication he would have taken at 0700 or 0730?
So...
I gave...
Yeah.
I gave Rob that information.
Well, not about the gaming.
I gave him the times when he's going to pass it on.
Okay.
Okay.
He's working...
He's working...
What position is he?
He's, um, clues, but he's working...like when I went in to talk to Michelle, she hadn't told both of them.
Okay.
So, okay.
I should make sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
Um, and that he will, um, he'll get...
He's also, um, tactile, tactile is important.
You asked how he soothes himself.
Besides with the blankies.
And like I said, he has one blankie that just...he's had it since he was an infant.
Um, he...the fidgety things, you know, fidget...what is it?
Oh, the fidget...
The squeeze...
Toys, yeah.
Oh, squish.
Yeah.
Like stress-related things.
Do you know what it looks like?
Um, he...he has one that's kind of a blue one.
And then he has several that are kind of multicolored.
And are these balls, or are they...
He has, um, like a...
Squishy...
He has a drab-colored squish ball.
But these are like, um, they look almost like spinners, but they're not spinners.
Yeah, the spinners.
Okay, yeah.
Um, yeah, I've seen those.
Does he carry the ball one around with him a lot?
Um, I don't...I don't know.
I don't know.
You know, sometimes it's home, sometimes it's not.
Sometimes he just throws it in his backpack.
I don't know where it is.
Would he have the blanket with him at the overnight?
I would say probably.
What color...
That's a guess.
Like I said, it's just a guess.
Yeah, okay.
It's been washed so many times, it's the most faded blue you've ever seen.
A faded blue?
And it's very, very, very well worn.
Sure.
Uh, very shabby.
But like I said, he's had it since he was an infant.
Um, and it's, it's the size of a baby blanket?
Yeah.
Kind of thing?
Okay.
And is that, uh...
That's really special to him, right?
Oh, yes.
Okay.
So he's going to hang on to that as best as you can.
Like I said, you know, we've offered to get him, but no, this has always been his, and even though it's shredding.
Does he, is that one of the things you said when he gets upset and he cowers and envelops himself, would that be one of the items?
It could be, yes.
Okay.
Um, that, uh, the fidget, the fidget clue, the fidget devices, and the, definitely the baby blanket, if you can get that over to them.
That's something they want to keep a lookout for?
Yeah.
Because that seems like a pretty secure thing for him.
Okay.
How are you doing, Debra?
I'm doing okay, thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you for asking.
I appreciate it.
Is it, is anything, no water or anything, or a snack?
It's, I'm sure you haven't had your breakfast yet.
I, as I was, I tend sometimes to have some low blood sugar, so I grab something, but thank you for checking.
Okay, you have something, okay, because we do have some snacks and stuff if you need anything.
Oh, thank you.
If you need anything.
Thank you.
I, I, I...
For real, I have snacks.
I may, I may, I may impinge upon you.
Okay, because it is early in the morning.
Yes.
For Saturday.
Okay.
Okay.
And I am not a morning person.
Did you see Liam before, prior to going to the overnight?
I didn't see him yesterday, but I saw him the day before after school and we, we talked about it.
Okay, and what were his feelings about going on the overnight?
Um, he was looking forward to it because he was supposed to meet a friend, I believe.
And, but he was a little, um, a little bit kind of, it's a new situation.
He hasn't spent an overnight, you know, at a camping thing like this.
So there was a little bit of, um, uh, what's the word?
Um, trepidation?
A trepidation.
Not anxiety, but let's say a little trepidation.
Okay.
Mild though?
Very mild.
Sorry, can I get, can we get the dresses for home and grandma's house?
Absolutely.
Do you have your, um...
Yeah.
Um, that seems like a big clue to me, looking up the address.
Well, I think it might have been in relation to our providing that he likes, he knows how
to work from.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
Which...
Um, okay, his house is 123 Los Altos Avenue in Walnut Creek.
Okay.
And of course, I'm at 456 Lennon Lane.
Okay.
Thanks.
Lennon Lane.
That's, uh, over there, isn't it?
That's, uh, where Kaiser is.
That's...
Is that address then actually a Kaiser building?
Is that address actually a Kaiser building?
I wonder.
Oh, it's just a random address they gave you?
Okay.
Okay.
Um, do you know who the friend was he was looking forward to seeing?
Was it Sophia?
Yes.
Sophia.
Okay.
I think they were going to go bike riding after the camp out.
Okay.
And where...
Yeah, I think they were going to go bike riding after the camp out.
Okay.
Where were the bikes?
Um, I guess they, they had them with them.
They, I guess the last I heard, the plan was, um, after the camp out, they were going to bike
to, I guess, Heather Farms, and I guess Steve was supposed to pick them up there.
I guess that was what the plan was the last I heard.
Which part of Heather Farms?
I don't know.
Okay.
Uh, we meet ASAP.
Mm-hmm.
That, he was, he was going to, he, so you think he brought his bike?
He did bring his bike.
He did bring his bike.
Okay.
He brought his bike, Sophia also, and they were supposed to go bike riding after the camp out,
and they were going to ride, um, to Heather Farms.
And then the, the dad was going to pick, pick them up.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, hold on one second.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What, what is this, do you know what his bike looks like?
It's gray.
Okay.
And it has Specialized on it.
Oh, Specialized, that's a good brand.
Is it a regular bike, or is it an e-bike?
I think it's a, I think it's a regular bike.
It's got some kind of gears on it, perhaps.
Oh, it's got gears, okay.
And, um, is it, uh, uh, like a mountain bike?
Does it have really rugged-looking tires, or is it pretty smooth-looking?
I don't think it's, I don't think it's a mountain bike.
Just kind of a basic gray.
Is this a silvery gray, or a dark gray?
Uh, a dark gray.
A dark gray.
Okay.
And, uh, it just has, like, uh, flat handlebars, like a normal, not, not like a racing bike.
Okay.
Breaking away.
Not, not like a breaking away bicycle.
That's a great movie.
I love that movie.
Okay.
So, uh, his bike, and his bike description is a gray Specialized.
Okay.
Okay.
Because they need to be looking up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And confirm with the camp director that they had their bikes.
So did he bring himself to, he, did he bring himself here with the bike?
No.
Uh, Steve, Steve dropped him off.
Dropped him off.
Okay.
And then, um, see if you can find out what's going on with getting Steve here for my interview.
Okay.
The dad.
Hi.
You, Steve hasn't been here?
Oh, he's actually out looking for Liam.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh, but, you know, there's a lot of information we'd like to, to know, you know.
Um.
Oh.
Just.
Absolutely.
Ask me anything.
Uh, does, do you know if he wears a helmet?
He's, he's usually a rule follower.
Oh, good.
Okay.
Usually.
Um.
He probably won't.
Do you know what color his helmet might be?
Uh, he has a couple of them, so.
Yep.
Okay.
That's okay.
Yeah.
All right.
And then does he, uh, do you know if his bike has a light?
So if he had, because it would have been dark.
Oh, that's right.
Oh.
Um, I don't remember.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
No, no.
Great.
No, Debra, you have given us so much information.
This is fantastic.
This is so helpful.
So helpful.
Um.
Definitely a lot of stuff that's, uh, come up.
It's really helpful.
Does he like, he likes to ride his bike a lot?
Yeah.
Okay.
Does he usually take a path?
Would he prefer the path over, um, the street?
Um, yes.
He would prefer the path over a street, yes.
Okay.
Does he know the bike path's around here in the park?
Um, yes, he does.
Like I said, I've taken him here.
I started in the stroller.
Yeah.
Oh, do you ride a bike also?
No.
Okay.
I can't.
I can't.
So, um, who does he, does he ride by himself in the park?
Or does he, um, come with his Sophia mostly?
Sometimes with Sophia.
Um, sometimes, you know, I'll come with him and he'll ride around and, you know, I'll sit
and enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air and he'll ride.
Okay.
So he'll just.
Sometimes with Sophia.
He'll go on his own and then come back to you?
Okay.
You do that a lot?
Um, not as often as we used to, but.
Okay.
But you used to do it a lot.
Okay.
Does he have a specific, uh, route he usually takes or is a specific, like, where would you
usually park to when he would go on the ride?
Um, I'd park over by Heather Farms parking lot.
Okay.
I know over there.
Okay.
And, um, he just would ride.
Kind of toodle around?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So he would go from there and then he would just, he would come back to you and then?
All right.
Does he know how to ride home on the bike?
From school.
Okay.
I believe he does, yes.
Has he ever ridden from the park to home or to your house?
Or either, or, or to the park?
He has.
Okay.
So he's comfortable on that route on the road.
I think so.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you like to ride?
He likes to ride a lot?
Sometimes.
I think, I think between riding and walking, um, maybe it's, he likes to walk and he likes
to ride, but like I said, with the, the daydreaming, he does more walking than riding.
Okay.
And also because he can daydream, you know, wherever he is and doesn't need the bike with
him, the bike he has to plan.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Would he, um, ever walk with the bike?
Like kind of just walk it along while he's walking so he could daydream a little?
I bet I don't know.
Okay.
I don't know.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
I don't know whether he would leave the bike and then daydream and then come back with
that.
I don't know.
Okay.
Okay.
So, um, the day before, or, let's see, you spoke to him on Thursday.
That was, um, was that in the morning or the evening or afternoon?
Um, it was in the afternoon when he came home from school.
Um, we were trying to get him to be more independent.
Yeah.
And he got his snack and I wished him well on the camp out.
Okay.
Told him I loved him.
Yeah.
And again, he was in pretty good spirits and everything.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I was just trying to get a hold of Steve.
Is that your son?
Yes.
Okay.
No, my son-in-law.
Your son-in-law.
Okay.
And they went to voicemail.
He's out searching somewhere.
Do you have another way to get in touch with him or?
No, I don't.
Just his phone number?
Just his phone number.
Okay.
All right.
I'll keep trying.
Oh, please.
And if you do get a hold of him, please let me know.
I will, and I'm going to have him come here so he can talk to you guys here.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That would be Steve.
He called me, as I told you, about him being missing, and that would be Steve.
I'm going to go look for him.
Okay.
Does he ever text with you?
Do you ever text?
I'm not much of a texter.
I'd have a flip phone if I had my wife.
Oh, yeah.
Do you have your phone with you?
Has he called since the last time?
No, he has not.
Do you mind, would you feel comfortable giving him a call?
Because maybe if he sees your number come up, he recognizes it.
Would that be all right?
Of course.
They got the info on the bike and everything.
Yep.
Uh-huh.
And he was calling, uh, Rob was calling the, talking to the camp director.
Okay.
Giving that information.
The bike is still there?
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
He does know how to ride home.
Okay.
So he's comfortable on the streets.
Okay.
And he's important, too, if the bike is not there.
Mm-hmm.
And did you confirm whether or not they had searched the house?
I did not.
But I told him about, that he knows how to walk home and whatnot.
Oh, okay.
What night?
Yeah, he's not answering.
He's not answering.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Do you have, are you connected on some kind of family plan or anything?
Is that an iPhone?
No, it's not an iPhone.
It's an Android.
It's a, what do you call it?
Android.
An Android phone.
Got it.
It's, uh, Apple has the, uh, those.
Oh, there we go.
Steve, I'm trying to get a hold of you.
And I haven't been able to get a hold of you.
And they asked me to call you, Steve.
Yeah, that's correct.
That's correct.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
I hope you have success at it.
Stepper, can we speak to Steve?
Where are you?
I'm at what they call the CP, the command post.
Okay.
Where is that?
How would I tell him exactly where this is?
By the dog park?
Yes.
By the dog park.
At the end of North Carlos.
North Carlos, I think.
At the end of the street of North Carlos.
The end of the street of North Carlos, okay.
And there's a lot of sheriff's vehicles.
And there's a lot of sheriff's vehicles.
You can't miss it.
Okay.
If you could just tell them.
Okay.
You're going to look some more and then you're going to come by.
Could I speak to him for a second?
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
Maura.
Maura.
Maura.
We'd like to talk to you.
Hi, Steve.
Is this Steve?
Hi, Steve.
Hi.
I was wondering.
I was wondering.
We have Debra here.
Your mother-in-law.
And she's been really helpful with some great answers to our questions.
She's given us some really fantastic information.
Very helpful.
But there are some questions I have for you that I think only you can specifically answer.
Are you able to come to our command post?
We have many teams out there looking for your son.
Okay.
Listen, I'm riding right now.
I can't talk on the phone.
I'm on my bike.
But I will come by there as soon as I can.
Right?
Okay.
Where are you right now, Steve, though?
Do you know which part of the park?
Uh, I don't know the park very well, but I will come by.
Okay.
If you could come.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Boy, that John Kalen.
He's got an addict.
Oh.
He didn't want to come?
He, yeah.
He wanted to search.
He's in a role.
Could you please go tell Ops, or tell Michelle, search manager, that we were able to contact Steve.
He's out on his bicycle.
He says he will come here, but he was saying it will be not immediately.
But he knows the location, and he's on his bike searching.
But we did make contact.
Okay.
Through Deborah.
Okay.
Thank you.
I know, like, I wanted to say, he's being rude, but I'm like, he's being belligerent.
But I can't say that in front of you.
But since this isn't, this is a.
We're taking a pause.
We're taking a little break.
I'll just say that.
I'm going to be like, he's being belligerent.
I'm sure that it's because he's nervous.
He's scared.
Yes.
Looking for his son.
I would never say that in real life.
I know.
Thank you for calling him.
Yes.
I'm sure that when he saw your phone number, that was a little bit more, he'd be a little
more responsive, more comfortable being responsive.
So did, he likes to ride with Liam, right?
Okay.
Would they go on bike rides a lot?
No, I won't say a lot, but some.
Okay.
Yeah.
Again, everybody's busy all the time.
Mm-hmm.
And, but every now and then, maybe once a month or whatever, they'll, if the weather's nice,
they'll take a bike ride.
Okay.
And a casual, a casual neighborhood ride?
Oh, yeah.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Oops.
Are there any restaurants he likes around here?
Liam?
Any of Liam likes?
Um, I don't know about restaurants, but he, one of our special treats is to go to Noah's Bagel.
Noah's Bagel?
And he loves the chocolate chip bagels there.
Oh, I hear they are good.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that is like one of his favorite things.
Which Noah's Bagel does he like?
Um, I think there's one right here at Countrywood.
At Countrywood?
Mm-hmm.
Do you have a Google?
Uh-huh.
How far away is that?
Is it just across the street?
Pretty much.
Oh.
Okay.
Let's go to, let's go.
It's the shopping center right across, um.
Oh, where the Trader Joe's is.
Oh, no, is that, is it Trader Joe's here?
It's a sports basement.
Oh, sports basement.
I'm in the wrong.
Oh, no.
Do you mean down, um, off Bancroft?
Yeah.
That's not the one right here.
Oh, okay.
That's down a little.
Oh, Bancroft, right, yeah.
Where Black Bear Diner is.
Yeah.
That's the closest one.
Does he like, uh, does he like, um, the Black Bear Diner?
I know my nephew loves the Black Bear Diner.
Um.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Okay.
Could be.
Would he have money with him so that he could go buy a chocolate chip bagel?
I didn't give him any money.
I don't know if, I don't know if he had money on him.
Okay.
And I don't know.
Does he, do you know if he sometimes has money with him?
Usually not.
No?
No.
Okay.
I mean, he and I go to Noah's, the two of us.
Yeah.
Okay.
And, you know, I.
Uh.
There's a bakery right here.
Are you familiar with the Sweet Affair Bakery?
I've heard of it.
Oh, okay.
But it's not a place that you guys frequent for a sweet treat.
Okay.
So he'd be okay.
Obviously he walks home.
He can walk home.
So he'd be okay crossing Ignacio and stuff.
Let's get, um, let them know that he likes the chocolate chip bagels at Noah's.
Because he could have gotten money from a friend or something.
Okay.
The bagel sounds really good right now.
Have you ever had the Boychek bagels?
No.
How are they?
They're very good.
Really?
Closest to a New York bagel you're going to get out here.
Okay.
And, um, they're going to open one in Concord.
And then they can, uh.
But I get them frozen.
So that they bake them out in Berkeley, freeze them.
And you can get them out here in Walnut Creek.
And.
Oh.
So they're pretty fresh because they freeze them.
Good to know.
Yeah.
I'll bring some to Joe.
I'll bring some to Steve next time.
At the next, uh, event.
It's our event.
Oscar.
This is Oscar.
This is Oscar.
Chris Young.
Okay.
Um.
Okay.
You think if he was hungry enough he'd go over there?
It's a possibility.
Possibility.
Okay.
Alright.
Like I said, I'm so concerned about him, his sugar getting too low or too high.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
If he was walking around and daydreaming and he missed his insulin, he's going to kind of gradually taper off
and then just find some place to kind of sit and rest?
That could be.
Okay.
That could be.
Would he be getting, would he, any anxiety over that?
Again, I, I'm not sure.
He, he could.
Um.
Um.
He, um.
Um.
Emotionally.
Again, it depends if he's getting weaker and weaker.
Um.
He would probably just find some place to sit.
Um.
He, I'm hoping he hasn't hurt himself.
You think he would try to hurt himself?
No, he wouldn't try to hurt himself.
Oh.
No, no, no.
He's not.
That's, that's, no, that's not something.
Like I said, he, he curls up.
But if something, if he hurt himself in some way, he wouldn't feel it.
He wouldn't feel an injury?
Not very much.
It's part of, it's part of the, being on the spectrum.
Okay.
Um.
Uh.
Kind of desensitized to physical touch of any kind.
Well, he, he also doesn't like being touched by, certainly by strangers.
I mean, yes, I'll get a hug, but I have to ask.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Um, but otherwise he.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So, uh, if he was going to sit somewhere, would he find a quiet place?
that's by himself or would he prefer to be around the dogs and the geese or would he find a bench?
I think he'd find a private place. Private place? Yeah or a bench somewhere.
A bench okay so he's going to want to be comfortable.
And would he try to avoid people as much as possible? Okay so the least crowded place. So
the park's you know it's kind of waking up a little bit and there's more people coming in. Would he
remove himself or stay put if more people were starting to come around him? If they're off kind
of at a distance I think he'd probably be okay. If he felt they were you know walking by him you know
really close and everything else. So if you kind of look around Deborah and you see the activity
right now is this a comfortable amount of distance and active level of activity for him? Where we're
we're sitting right now? Yeah without all our stuff our presence but the the cyclists and the dogs,
walkers. Because they're off at a distance it's okay. If they were walking right by this path
he would not be comfortable. Okay he would leave. So he would probably be a bit removed from the walking
half at this point. Probably a bit. Again it depends how he's his strength of how he's managing. How does he do in the dog park with people? So the dogs are there which he's comfortable with the dogs. He really enjoys the dogs. Is he okay if he's around the dogs but their human owners are there too? Um he would be
He would be, sometimes the humans stay outside, and he would be comfortable with the dogs.
But if there were too many people, he would probably leave.
If there were too many people around.
Okay.
If there were just a few and there were the dogs and everything, he could be comfortable with that.
Okay.
So the amount of people over in the dog park right there, that's okay?
Oh, yeah.
No.
That's fine.
That's fine.
Okay.
All right.
Deborah, is there anything else that you could think of that is, you know, his state of mind at this point?
Okay.
What would be his top priority right now?
His top priority?
I don't know, because I don't know what caused him to leave.
his top priority would probably be to be comfortable.
Okay.
And...
Like I said, he doesn't feel pain the way the rest of us do.
You mean the physical pain or also emotional pain?
Physical pain. Emotional, he tends perhaps to process it a bit differently.
In what way?
Where other people might go for help or whatever emotionally, he will withdraw.
He will not seek help.
So withdraw socially and then also physically take that shelter.
Shelter, shelter.
Under his blanket.
Does his blanket have a special name or anything like that?
Blanky.
Blanky.
I like that.
It's very concise.
One of his first words.
Blanky.
Blanky.
Was it?
That's, uh...
Okay.
One moment.
I'll let you catch your breath for a second.
Even two breaths.
Not bad.
Two breaths are good, too.
Okay.
Do you think if he saw us and our orange jackets coming into the area, would he be afraid or adverse to having us be anywhere near him as opposed to someone in street clothes?
He would possibly be more comfortable.
Maybe...
The uniforms identify you.
If there were several, he would withdraw.
Okay.
If several people in uniform came toward him, he would probably withdraw.
But one would you?
One person.
Okay.
Um...
Um...
And...
And again, at a...
Not a...
A total...
As close as I am to you.
Mm-hmm.
But, um...
At a distance, very slow.
Um...
Obviously, not threatening.
Um...
Uh...
If the person approaching him had a squishy or something, or a fish is fit or something like that, that would certainly help.
Not fidgety.
Um...
Um...
Does he...
Would he find a smaller person less intimidating, and does he respond better to female or male?
Um...
It's...
It's a good question.
I mean, he's close to his dad.
He's close to his mom.
He's close to me.
Okay.
Um...
Um...
Again, in a very...
Soft...
He...
He...
A very soft voice.
A very slow approach.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
He...
He...
He does like, um, music.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
He likes, uh...
Uh...
Uh...
The Disney stuff.
Um...
Um...
He...
He...
He doesn't like loud noises.
As I said, he does not like crowds.
Um...
Obviously, he knows his own name and all that.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
He would respond to my...
My voice, if he heard it.
Um...
Okay.
His...
His dad's voice.
Um...
And, again, also, if he's, you know, uh...
Hasn't taken his meds and isn't doing well, that way that would also affect how he responds.
How he responds.
Does he get more agitated or anything like that?
Um...
Perhaps more withdrawn.
More withdrawn?
And...
Again, I'm...
I'm hoping that he hasn't hurt himself in any way because he would not be aware.
Okay.
He would not...
I didn't hear that.
He wouldn't be aware.
Oh, yeah.
He hurt himself.
Got it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm thinking that maybe if...
If we do...
Like, when we find him, that, um...
The orange jacket might be...
Would that...
Would that be bothersome because it's bright?
Um...
If...
If it's explained to him.
Okay.
But the color wouldn't aggravate him or...
I don't...
I don't think so.
Okay.
I think...
If it was explained to him and, um...
That...
This is so that he could see...
He could find you.
Kind of thing.
Okay.
And then, um...
The radio...
Would that be jarring to him?
If he heard the talking on the radio?
If it was explained to him what it was...
Okay.
I think he would be okay.
Okay.
If it wasn't explained and he heard the...
The crackling and everything...
Yeah.
He might be...
Okay.
So, um...
And then I was thinking maybe...
If, uh...
Uh...
When our teams find him...
An individual female...
Gently approaching would probably...
You know...
Who's not intimidating would be...
Probably the best...
Okay.
The best first contact.
Okay.
Perhaps.
At...
Like I said, with that...
And so for a normal person...
Uh...
About a three...
Three and a half foot distance...
This is kind of our space, right?
So this is...
What we're normally comfortable with.
Would you say he's a little more comfortable...
With twice that amount of space?
Okay.
At the beginning.
Yeah, yeah.
The initial.
That's where our team members should stop...
At about six feet from him.
Talk to him.
Make him feel comfortable.
Okay.
He's basically a very, very sweet kid.
Oh, yeah.
He sounds like it.
He sounds like a lovely, lovely, wonderful person.
He's very bright.
And he's...
Yes, he's on the spectrum.
But he's not...
He...
We can kind of tease his...
He's got a foot on the spectrum.
Mm-hmm.
Not all of him on the spectrum.
Mm-hmm.
One foot on the spectrum.
Okay.
So he is functioning at a 12-year-old level?
Um...
Are you talking...
Um...
His grades are way up there.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
Emotionally, he's a bit below.
Below?
Okay.
A bit below emotionally.
Just a little bit?
Okay.
he's
he's got
a pretty good sense of self
okay good
if we called his name would he respond?
it would depend
if it was done
depending on how withdrawn he is
if it was done
quietly
very gently
he probably would
okay
so he responds to your voice
and both Steve and his mom's voice too?
absolutely
do you think he would respond better to
the female voice calling out to him?
if it was a very gentle
gentle
I mean he gets along okay with his male teachers
and everything
and of course with his dad
but in terms of strangers?
he doesn't like strangers
he doesn't do well with strangers
so that's why
is it
yeah I think your suggestion is probably a very good one
okay so
alright Deborah I'm just gonna pause right here for a moment
I'm going to suggest that they could probably put on Slack
that teams should approach slowly and give a six-foot distance
if they make contact, and that one team member should approach,
preferably female.
Any call-outs should be done softly.
Had a non-aggressive approach, gentle approach.
And he doesn't like loud noises.
He doesn't like being touched.
And he doesn't like physical touch.
And if he is injured, he might not know that he's injured.
So that, if they do, when they find him, that's important.
Okay.
Does he have a guidance counselor or anything?
Do you want me to go?
Do you like that?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
A therapist.
He has a therapist?
Who's...
Does he go frequently?
Once a week now.
Was he going more regularly before or less?
At the very beginning, it was several times.
Okay.
He was diagnosed at three and a half, which is very fortunate,
because the earlier they start working with him, the much better the success is.
Do you have a therapist name?
Do you know who the therapist is?
I don't remember what the name is.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's okay.
That's great.
I believe it was through...
I believe it was through Kaiser.
Through Kaiser?
Okay.
Steve would know.
Steve would know.
Does Liam get upset easily?
Less so than when he was younger.
But, again, it depends where he is and what else is going on.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
He can...
You know, it can be like a trigger.
Mm-hmm.
You know, like I said, when he left the house, you know, there were a lot of people,
and it got very noisy, and he just...
So it depends on the situation.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you think that...
If our team kind of uses more of a sing-songy voice,
I'm trying to think of what would be the best way to say that, would that be better?
Not necessarily sing-song, but very gentle.
Just very gentle.
That kind of a voice.
Yeah.
Okay.
When you look at him and...
He's okay with eye contact?
Yeah, that's one of the things that they work on in therapy.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Because a lot of them...
Correct, yes.
And they also can't read faces.
Mm-hmm.
But that is something...
That was part of the training.
Okay.
And so he knows...
To be able to read faces.
He knows the facial emotions, like smiling and...
He can.
He can.
Like I said, they've been working on that.
Okay.
That's great.
Sounds like he's done...
Made some really great progress.
Oh, that is.
So that's amazing.
Okay.
Is there any kind of car city likes, or buses, trains, boats, things like that?
Steve has taken him to a couple of the train shows and a couple of the car shows.
I don't know if he's into it or not.
Not particularly.
Okay.
How prevalent is the Disney...
Like, you know, his liking of Disney?
He likes Disney.
Is it a really strong kind of thing?
Sort of, you know, he's...
Again, Disneyland was very difficult because of the crowds.
Yeah.
But he likes the Disney characters and the fun and the Pixar stuff.
And, you know, a lot of Disney has to do with littles, with little kids, which he loves.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Little, um, so...
Okay.
Do we know if there's anything...
And some of the Disney music...
The Disney music.
...is played softly.
That, I know he would...
Does he have a favorite?
Does he like the newer stuff or the older?
Good question.
He liked Moana.
Moana.
Moana.
And, um...
I think Moana was one of his favorites.
He likes the music from it?
That was a pretty good movie.
He's been to Hawaii, so there was that.
He likes Hawaii, the water, yes.
um
oh they're putting out our information
can you guys hear that oh you can where are you hearing it from
not from you that's over there yeah that's something off script that's probably something
in our uh debrief we should mention that the interview area shouldn't because you can hear
all that stuff right yeah i can hear just about everything yeah so that's probably not what they're
doing a pretty good job of parenting yeah the grandmother probably worried grandmother doesn't
need to know that he misses insulin and all that stuff so do we need to check him with the dad again
are we just leaving him to get here when he gets here yeah he so we made contact right
and he was saying he doesn't you know he's still going to be out looking but um come when he gets
around to a kind of thing maybe so if you could go let them know that he likes moana and that if
they're if somebody's able to play some of that music he might be drawn to them softly softly yeah
They can play that on their phone softly if he hears it.
Is there a particular song for Moana he likes?
I don't know.
One of the lovely, lovely kind of.
Does he like Moana's voice or does he like The Rock's voice?
Moana.
Moana.
Okay, so any of the ones that the female lead is singing?
Also, if he's found and if he's really just not responding, whatever, if you could hear my voice or Steve's voice, you know, call in and I could say, hi, sweetheart.
You know, how are you doing?
And he could hear that.
That might be helpful.
Deborah, what's your number?
925-899-9200.
Okay, so they'll leave that number and the, well, let's do Deborah because she's here.
Okay.
And then she'll call, the team member can call in for that number.
Okay.
And I would not say, Milo, Liam, what have you done?
No, it would be, oh, I'm glad, who are you talking to?
And it's okay, sweetheart.
And I look forward to seeing you real soon.
And maybe we can get a chocolate chip bagel.
You know, just to entice her.
And we're all going to come with you for that one.
Yeah, so if the team member, when they find them, that CP should give them that information to talk to.
If that helps, if he's responding, that's okay, too.
Okay.
Yeah.
As a potential means.
And then the Moana music.
Mm-hmm.
And a Nana call.
What's that?
And a Nana call.
A Grandma call.
Grandma call.
And a Grandma call.
Okay.
Okay.
I wore my...
What's that say?
My favorite people...
Call me...
Call me Nana.
Nana.
Nona.
Nana.
Nana.
Nana.
That's kind of old.
He likes that.
He likes the t-shirt, the sweatshirt.
He gave it to me.
Oh, nice.
Okay.
Let's see.
Okay.
What other kind of routines does he have that he does very regularly on an everyday daily basis?
Um, he...
They've...
They're trying to build his independence since he's 12.
And so he gets his own breakfast.
Um, he's supposed to get his school stuff out the night before so that it's all ready to go.
Mm-hmm.
And, um, he gets himself to school most of the time.
Um, and then comes home, um, has a snack.
Um, so he...
He's got a pretty good routine going, so he knows what to expect.
Gets his snack.
Um, sometimes he will stay after school for a school activity like Dungeons and Dragons or something like that.
Um, and then come home.
And then homework.
And then dinner.
And then maybe gaming.
And then bedtime.
It's a pretty regular kind of thing.
Pretty regular schedule.
So he likes Dungeons and Dragons.
Loves it.
He loves it.
Does he like it?
Indy.
Does he like it more than Disney?
Um, yeah.
How about gaming?
Now that he's getting older.
Yep.
Yep.
Okay.
Now that he's getting older.
Yep.
Does he have any, um, Dungeons and Dragons?
I honestly don't know a lot about Dungeons and Dragons, so does he have anything nearby, Dungeons and Dragons related he'd be drawn to?
I don't know.
No, because that's an online thing.
Oh, he does it online.
Okay.
It's an online game.
Okay.
And sometimes, um, he and maybe a couple of friends will get together and they're playing it at the same time in the same place.
Okay.
But otherwise, it is, it's an online, I mean, it is an online game.
Okay.
Okay.
I remember when I was in person, didn't they dress up?
Yeah.
What are you guys talking about?
Oh, Dungeons and Dragons.
I think originally it was like a board game and they dressed up in character.
Yeah.
It's a big following.
Yeah.
A big cult following.
I'm going to pause.
We're going to take out some minutes.
So, off script.
So, what was the communication there?
What do you mean?
Just from my learning experience.
Oh, me and Michelle?
Yeah.
What was her response?
She thought it was really helpful.
Okay.
So, she wrote it all down and, yeah.
This is, you know, we're all learning.
We're all learning.
Yeah.
So, I need to know if I'm sending you back and forth with irrelevant information.
I'm also taking note of, but so far everything has been well received.
Oh, good.
Okay.
Back on script.
Thank you, Debra.
You're doing a great job.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
After we're done, I'll tell you a story.
But anyway, go ahead.
Oh, okay.
Oh, good.
So, you said you're pretty sure he doesn't have his phone or at least he's not supposed to.
He's a pretty good rule follower.
Okay.
Any chance you know if he has an iPhone?
He does not.
His phone.
Okay.
His phone wouldn't be an Apple.
It would be an Android phone?
I don't know.
Do you ever text him at all?
Any chance?
Me?
Text?
Yeah.
No?
Like I said, I would still be using a flip phone if my husband didn't insist that I grow up.
Oh, okay.
Well, I know your husband and I know he likes his gadgets.
Wait, so he has a phone?
No, but it's not an iPhone.
Do you know his cell phone number?
Liam's?
Liam's?
No?
Okay.
Does he have any other kind of tracking devices?
Like an Apple tag or something?
No.
Like an Apple tag.
I know.
Okay.
Because sometimes parents will sew them into the clothing or something like that.
Onto a backpack or something like that.
Yeah, yeah.
No, he does not have it.
Okay.
Let's see.
Okay.
You don't think he'll hide from us, though, right?
Just want to make sure.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
Like I said, as long as it's a very gentle approach.
Okay.
Did you?
Yeah.
And done in a soft voice.
And I think it should be okay.
Did I?
Maybe I missed this, but I'm just curious if there are places that you might be aware of
that he would ride his bike to outside the park or even inside the park versus, like,
where he would walk to.
Any places he repeatedly goes with Sophia when he's on his bike as opposed to on his bike?
It's kind of the trails just sort of randomly, it sounded like.
Oh, okay.
I wasn't sure if you guys talked about that.
Not on the bike.
On the bike, he stays on the path.
Okay.
And in the park?
Pretty much, yeah.
How does he feel about his bike?
Is it one of his favorite things?
He kind of takes it for granted, you know.
Oh, okay.
It's there and it's his and it's a special bike.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But he would, is it really important to him that it would be with him at all times?
Probably.
Okay.
All right.
So he's not going to just leave it somewhere unless he really had to.
Exactly.
Okay.
All right.
As a rule follower, he's going to follow all rules, you would say.
Pretty much, yeah.
Rules of the road, rules of the park.
As long as he's thinking about it.
If he's thinking about something else, if there's something else going on, then he might not.
Okay.
But usually.
But that would be, would that be more under circumstances of it being unintentional that he's just sort of distracted and he's not intentionally breaking a rule or something?
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of behaviors would he have that might stand out to us as people looking for him that would be like, oh, that's Liam kind of thing?
If he's folded up into himself.
Okay.
If he doesn't want to make eye contact.
If he moves his body away.
As I said, he does not like to be touched.
So any movement that he might construe as somebody trying to touch him, he would completely withdraw.
And he might just take off if he was standing.
He might just take off.
Like I said, I've been so close to him for all these years.
I'm trying to look at it kind of from the outside looking in.
But you know, Deborah, it's because you've been so close to him all these years, all that information, you have much better insight.
So whatever you're thinking of is going to be really good to let us know.
So if there's anything, anything that just pops into your mind, even if you don't think it's going to be helpful, just definitely voice it and let us know.
Okay.
Thank you very much for what you are saying.
Because I can't physically go out and look for him.
But you're making me feel that I'm helping.
And that makes me feel good to my wife.
Thank you.
Oh, of course.
Yes.
You are definitely a huge help.
You've given us some really unique and important information that we wouldn't have been able to buy or else otherwise.
So very, very helpful.
When he learned to speak, do you know, did he develop all of his cognitive abilities as a child at a normal rate and everything?
His speech was delayed.
Okay.
He did for a while have like a stammer.
He was about four.
A stammer or a stutter?
I think, well, a little bit of each.
Okay.
Another behavior that he does only when he, usually only when he's alone, is flapping.
He likes to flap his arm?
Yes.
Does he do it a lot?
When he's alone.
When he's doing his daydreaming, he usually doesn't, unless he's, let's say, in the backyard or in the house or something like that.
And then he might flap.
But again, if somebody, if he's wandering around here and notices a bit of a flap, that could be him.
And would he be in a daydream state when he's doing that?
When he's in a daydream state, especially like if he's in the house or whatever, and I need to ask him something, I always apologize for interrupting his daydreaming.
Okay.
And then he will respond if I just say something often.
And he will ignore it.
Okay.
So apologize first.
If he's staying.
If he's...
I'll bring you another chair.
Debra, how are you doing?
I'm heading.
Is this...
Are you Steve?
How are you doing?
I'm Steve.
Hi, Steve.
I'm Mara.
Mara.
Pleasure to meet you, Mara.
Asking some questions.
I'm Wendy.
Hi, Wendy.
I'm helping Mara.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, Tom.
Thank you guys for being out here.
This is crazy.
We're going to get you a chair.
Do you need...
You're riding around a lot.
Do you need some water or a snack?
No, I'm okay.
I'm just...
I'm just...
I'm just...
I'm just getting nervous.
Okay.
Debra has been wonderful.
She's been giving us some really great, insightful information about your son.
And just building a picture of what a wonderful young man he is.
Yes.
Yes.
But we were talking about his bike.
And I guess you guys do a lot of bike riding and everything.
Oh, we've got it.
Are you sure?
We've got an important example.
Do you speak to the ladies?
Thank you.
For real.
For real.
Oh, okay.
I only ask because we need to keep eyes on our interview subjects.
This is for real.
So if you will excuse me.
Okay.
Can I do it myself?
You're going to come back.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, you do have your cell phone on.
Yes, I do.
Keep her magazine, though.
She's got to come back.
Yeah, okay.
There you go.
Collateral.
All right.
That's fine.
So, Steve, thank you for coming to our command post to ask those questions.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you for coming.
I guess take some breaths.
Try and get yourself into a better place for just a moment and then ask you some questions.
First of all, does Liam have a cell phone?
No.
He doesn't have any phone at all?
No.
I was supposed to meet him after his camp.
Okay.
Yeah, he was supposed to ride a, he was just going to bike ride with a friend.
Okay.
Sophia, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I was supposed to meet him, you know, kind of down by the pond.
And then they called me, the school called me and said that, you know, the last notice they had, I think it was like four in the morning.
Kind of some bed check or something.
I don't know what it was.
What time did the school call you?
It was probably 6.30.
And then, what time were you supposed to meet them at the pond?
Around 10.
10 a.m.?
So you were at home when the school called you?
Yeah.
Okay.
What part of the pond were you supposed to meet them at?
It was between the pond and the playground.
Okay.
Have you, had he, had you seen him the, right before coming to the sleepover?
No.
His grandmother dropped him off.
The, oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Was he at, did she pick him up from home or was he at her house?
I was, I was at work.
So I'm assuming she got him from, from, she was at our house.
Mm.
Okay.
That's, um.
Because she watches him while we're working.
Yeah.
You said at your house?
Yeah.
Yeah.
My wife's traveling right now.
Okay.
So that's interesting because that's not what she told us.
A little different.
Yeah.
She didn't, she didn't say she dropped him off.
No, she didn't.
She saw us just on the day before the sleepover.
So that would have been Thursday.
So...
Off script I'm saying that.
Yeah, yeah.
Off script, I'll tell you not to put a lot of time into that.
Okay.
You are back coordinated.
Okay, perfect.
Thank you.
That's helpful.
I don't want you to go down that road.
I was going to say, that's like a really big discrepancy right there.
That's very helpful.
Okay, thank you.
They don't get along.
Right, right.
We can take this all kinds of times.
I'm going to unstar that line.
Sorry, we don't have that.
No, there's been a lot of different information coming in that I think it's just...
We were...
At least I was given bullet points.
You have to fill in a lot of the blanks yourself.
Just so you know, Grandma knows more about this situation than Dad.
Oh, okay.
So whatever she told you is...
Go with that.
Oh, gotcha.
That's helpful.
Okay.
Yeah.
Back?
Yeah.
Back in the zone.
I'm not going to do much work to you guys.
Oh, okay.
Dad doesn't know anybody, so...
Okay.
Do you know if he...
Do he ever talk to you about being bullied at school or anything like that?
No.
Recently?
No.
Okay.
So if he was feeling uncomfortable or something happened at the overnight and he got on his bike and started riding through the park, would you think he would go to where you were supposed to pick him up?
That's a great question.
That area?
You know, he's got social challenges and strangers.
And if he was feeling awkward, he generally kind of retreats and he finds a quiet, calming place.
Usually in his home, obviously, he's comfortable there.
But out here, I couldn't even tell you where that would be because it's so foreign and strange.
And everybody are strangers.
But he generally tries to find a quiet, calming place.
He's not going to go towards traffic or where people are.
He's going to try to stay where he can kind of calm down.
Does Liam have a house key?
No.
Okay.
Does he know of any location of a spare key around the outside of the house?
No.
Okay.
Is there any way he could access entry into the house without a key?
I don't think so.
With his ability.
I mean, he's a smart kid and he's very high functioning.
But skills to break into a house, I don't know.
But maybe the back door is often left unlocked or something like that.
No.
No, it's pretty tight.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Me?
Me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, pause a little break.
And I'm not going to.
Okay.
Have you guys come up with anything?
Are there any, have you, any, anybody come back or you have any?
I haven't heard anything yet.
But we've been really focused on getting information from Debra and she's been really helpful.
She gave us a lot of insight into him.
She spends a lot of time.
Yeah.
A lot of time.
Sounds like they have a wonderful relationship.
Have you been able to develop a good portrait, I think, of your son?
And have you been in contact with your wife?
I've been trying.
I've been trying to get a hold of her.
I've left messages with her company.
I was kind of delaying a little bit because she has major anxiety and I didn't want to, especially
being overseas, I'm not being able to do anything.
So I wanted to tread lightly, but I did make the call to her company to, you know, try to get
a hold of her.
But no, I haven't.
I actually don't have your wife's name, I think.
Yeah.
What's her name?
Let's say it's Sue.
Sue in quotes.
Get down Debra.
Get down Debra.
Go to your wife.
You just call her wife.
Hey, wife.
Hey.
Hey, you.
That wasn't very nice to leave.
Right.
She left out and done.
Do you know, have you met Sophia, Liam's friend?
No, I have not.
Oh, okay.
So today would have been the first day you would have met her?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I couldn't, yeah.
And is, is she in the same grade as he is?
Where do they usually hang out then if they're, you know, it sounds like they're really good
friends and she's a really good friend to him.
Yeah, there's a program after school, you know, that they do.
Come together.
What kind of school is that, program is that, sorry?
It's just an after school kind of daycare and it's more science based.
Oh.
You know, where it's more interactive.
It's not just kind of child care babysitting.
Does he gravitate to more science-y type stuff?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Yeah.
Is there anything around here that he would be interested in?
Not, just nature.
You know, the science of nature and the animals and the ducks and he seems to enjoy that.
Other than Sophia and, you know, you and your wife, wife, wife, his grandmother, does he,
and I see he's got a therapist as well, does he have any other confidants that he might confide in?
Not that I'm aware of.
We're pretty tight with, you know, his grandma, my wife, and myself.
It's pretty much his adult, you know, social group, support group.
Would he be pretty open to letting you know, on his terms, of course, about being bullied
or any difficulties he's having outside of the family?
That's the challenge, is he kind of retreats.
He doesn't share that kind of stuff.
We have to look at his body language and the difference in his demeanor to recognize that,
but verbally he doesn't share that with us.
Have you noticed anything like that in the last couple days?
Not in the last couple days.
It's been a while.
Okay.
All right.
How many people do you guys have?
Well, it sounds like we have six or seven teams, I believe, out there right now,
and it looks like about teams of three.
And you're aware of his medical condition?
He's a type one diabetes.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm assuming he hasn't had any food since last night.
Mm-hmm.
So I'm getting kind of worried about that.
Yes.
Your folks have first aid or you're on speed dialed?
We have a week.
Yes.
You're a medic.
Yes.
So we can, you know, John Muir is right down the road, and we can get an ambulance here quickly,
and we do have immediate first aid items that we can treat.
We can treat immediately.
That's my biggest concern right now is blood sugar.
What's that?
Yes.
Yeah.
We're able to treat for that in the immediate moment.
And then, like I said, the ambulance could be here within minutes.
Okay.
Well, I'll see.
Yeah.
So, um.
But, uh.
Anything?
Any?
Um, well, we don't know what his wife's name is.
We're calling her Sue.
We're calling her Sue.
Susan is my middle name, so that makes sense.
Okay.
Makes sense.
Yes.
I like Dorothy.
What's that?
I like Dorothy.
Dorothy is a good name, too.
There are two little details.
Steve basically said that you would probably know her name since she's your daughter.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Her name's Susan, but she goes by Sue.
That's right.
Exactly.
Okay.
You know.
All right.
Steve, do you know if, uh, Liam has any money on him?
I'm not.
He generally doesn't.
No.
Okay.
Yeah.
Would it be possible that he could have money, like a couple dollars on him?
I doubt it.
He's not even aware of money.
That I know.
Um, if there was an obstacle or something that he needed to kind of think through or figure
out, would he be able to do that?
Can he problem solve?
He can.
To assert, as long as he's not too scared.
Okay.
Because then he has a hard time focusing when he's, when he's scared.
Um, but in his kind of normal state, very, very intelligent young man.
Uh-huh.
That's why I'm not, I'm not real concerned about him just walking or riding off and, you
know, a long distance.
It's, it's about his blood sugar.
Uh-huh.
And what's that, what's that doing to him, so.
Thinking of your son now, do you think he's still in the park?
I don't think he's gone too far.
That's my gut.
I just don't see, I think that at some point he would put on the brakes and go, okay, I'm
not familiar with this area.
I don't know any of these people.
I'm scared.
I'm going to hunker down and try to calm myself.
And that, like I said, that's going to be a, probably a quiet, quiet place.
So he doesn't know the park very well, you think, or?
That's a hard call.
I mean, we've been here before, um, but I don't know how much he retains on that visit.
So it just.
He's having a good time.
Oscar.
But does he know?
Apparently he knows the park very well.
Yeah.
You're coming here.
That's what you meant.
That's what you meant.
That's where you guys go.
Yeah.
Well, that's true.
Okay.
And even before, when he was little and I'd push him in the stroller, I'd bring him here.
I took him here like two years ago.
I see.
Played with the ducks.
Hey, he says you keep me around for, right?
That's right.
Grandma.
I feel like I should be an investigator.
Child services.
Your stories aren't matching up.
You too.
Child services.
I'm going to chalk it up that I'm, I'm so scared of my son.
Yeah.
I was thinking straight.
Yeah.
So I'm just whacked out because I'm not, I'm worried about my son.
That makes sense.
Yes, absolutely.
Because I want him found as soon as possible.
Yeah.
I will fall apart later.
Okay.
See?
Stronger, stronger, stronger than me.
No, just compartmentalizing.
And like I said, later I'll probably lie on the ground and speak, but you know.
I'm going to jump on my bike and go try to find him again.
So I'll, I would like, um, uh, completely understand Steve.
But, uh, would you mind just, uh, staying and keeping Deborah company and just kind of
being a support for each other just for a few more minutes?
Is that, are you okay with doing that?
Follow up in our notes and get our scores.
Yeah.
Maybe get your story straight before I come back.
I got a meeting to go to.
I'm just kidding.
Um, no, it's.
Those notes.
No, but, uh, back on script.
If you, uh, would you mind, uh, you know.
Sounds like a good time to do it.
Support to each other and just, uh, you know, so you're not by yourselves just for a little
bit.
And then, uh, you know, maybe later.
Just please, any information you guys have.
Oh, absolutely.
We need to know.
Yeah, as it's coming in.
Time clock's ticking.
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.
And it was like I was saying to Deborah, she's been primary source for us of information.
You guys are our primary source of information.
You're, you're going to be the voice of Liam for now.
Okay.
So, uh, that, that's, that's why you, you are both very important to our, uh, the ability
to find him.
Okay.
I'm going to step away.
I have to go to a quick little briefing over there with some of the higher ups to find out.
And I'm going to get more information of what's going on over there.
So I'm just going to excuse myself for a couple minutes.
It won't be that long.
Uh, Wendy's going to be here.
Um, a small talk.
Yeah.
I know.
Chit chat.
I can do that.
Um, yeah.
And if anything comes up, that's great.
Um, you know, like I said, if you could, you know, please stay until I come back.
Okay.
Okay.
Really appreciate it.
Um, if you need anything, you just let Wendy know and she can wave at me to, to get it for
you.
You could text me.
It's Mara.
Mara.
Yeah.
Mara.
Yes.
Uh, so Wendy, you can just text me if they need anything.
I'll bring it over.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
You stay with them.
Them.
Yeah.
You stay with them.
I will.
And scene.
Yeah.
And scene.
Okay.
Hey, Mara.
Mara.
Can we turn this thing off?
Uh, no, you can keep it running.
Because your story is not a good one.
Well, you said scene, so I want to be off scene, but okay.
Okay.
Well, we tried.
We tried.
We tried.
We tried.
You guys pretty much covered all your list.
I feel like I had to step away quite a number of times to relay information.
So I feel a tiny bit out of the loop as to what we fully, what she fully covered.
Um, cause I was relaying info back to plans and the search manager.
As it came in.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Because such good information was provided.
But it did seem like she was going through, going through.
Did you guys talk about outdoor experience and stuff like that?
I noticed that part of the, yeah.
Okay.
I figured she, yeah.
Very good.
Um, yeah.
I don't know how far she got in this.
Actually, it looks like she might have gotten pretty far.
Show me now.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is he a boy scouter?
Liam involved with the scouts or anything?
He's, he's, he's the game player.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Loves the game.
Yep.
But he doesn't have any sort of portable gaming device, like a Switch or a Nintendo Game
Boy that he could go off and.
Unless you gave him one.
Yep.
Okay.
I don't think the camp, the camp would have.
Well, that's a good point.
They wouldn't have, yeah.
That's part of it.
Yeah.
Oh, they said they did.
It was here, right?
Seven Hills?
Yeah.
I don't even think so.
But, you know, sometimes kids sneak them in.
Not fun.
No.
Mine used to get up in the middle of the night.
Well, my husband and I were, yeah.
Seriously?
Apparently, they told us they're now in their 20s.
That's their, that's their, felt like they got.
So now they came clean.
Exactly.
They came clean.
And we actually, it's kind of funny, we, our younger one wanted a Netflix account.
We're like, absolutely not.
But he, oh.
I have a question for you.
So it looks like they found a bike.
We just want to get visual confirmation from you that this is his bike.
I don't know if you can see that.
It does, it doesn't look like it's a Specialized though, but is it?
No.
No.
No?
It's a Specialized bike.
It's not his bike?
It is Specialized?
And is it a, um.
He does have a Specialized bike.
Yeah, that's not a Specialized bike.
Oh.
I got it.
It's like a gray, grayish.
Yeah, it's dark gray.
This one's Silver.
It's Silver, and it doesn't say Specialized.
It says Pro XTR on it.
It looks like it's a BMX type bike, not a.
No, I remember it was a Specialized.
Is it.
It's kind of gray, gray blue.
Is it kind of like a mountain bike?
No, no.
No, that's not it.
No.
Is it more like a mountain bike?
It's like a, yeah.
Like a hybrid.
Like a hybrid.
Okay.
Huh.
Like my husband's car.
A hybrid.
What'd you say?
Like my husband's car.
A hybrid.
Oh.
I know.
That's all I want.
That's all I want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are we back on?
No, I'm going to the meeting.
Oh, okay.
Thank you for being here.
It's supposed to warm up this afternoon, but I hope it was warm enough.
I hope.
At least it didn't rain.
What's that?
Did you send him with some heavy clothes?
He had a sweatshirt.
Did he have his blankie in his backpack, do you know?
Or any of his fidget toys?
They're usually left in there, so if he took his backpack there, that's where they usually are.
So he probably has one.
Okay.
Good to know.
Did they confirm that he has his backpack at the school?
I don't know the answer to that question.
He has it with him.
They were going to ask.
That was on the...
Let's see if it...
And this wasn't his shoe?
Did you see this?
Oh.
She said no.
Well, I don't remember having seen it.
No.
Did I take a cord with you?
That's hilarious.
I told him I had bullet point.
I had no detail.
I can't even...
I'm kind of making it up.
I'm messing them up, I'm sure.
No, no.
It's part of their training, right?
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
Trust me, if you ask my husband any detail about our kids, he would literally have no idea.
And we see things differently.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But he would...
Yeah.
A blue shirt.
What are you talking about?
Right, right.
But he would know things that...
He would know all the gaming stuff, and I would have no idea.
Like, I know it's on a TV or a laptop.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So my lack of information is natural.
Yeah.
It's, you know...
Yeah.
Son-in-law.
Yeah, there you go.
What's happening?
No, we got along okay.
No, we got along okay.
I won't tell you what she said.
This isn't my fault.
This isn't my fault.
No, and nobody said it.
You were at work, right?
I was just glad you called me to let me know that he was missing.
I was just a mean at the park.
I've driven on a bike.
I've ride the bikes.
I've got that phone call you never want to get.
Right.
That's no fun.
Nope.
Nope, nope.
Just curious if they provided any of this information.
Did the school or the camp say that they had looked in X, Y, and Z places?
Did they give you any information about what they had done?
I'm just curious.
In the sheet that you got.
They said they looked on their campus.
On their campus.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, and they couldn't find them.
That's where they called.
Okay, got it.
They called him on a pre-PD, and I'm sure he called first.
Okay, okay.
And he, you know, was missing.
Got it.
Interesting.
They did a quick search around there probably.
Okay.
And you said that they discovered he wasn't in a sleeping bag when they did the 4 a.m. bag check?
That's what I heard.
Okay.
Was it the 4 a.m. or the 6 a.m.?
I think it was the 6 a.m.
6 a.m.?
Okay.
So, I think it was the last time they actually saw him.
It was 4 a.m.
For that bad check.
It's 6 a.m.
Oh, I see.
And they called you at 6.30 a.m.
Got it.
So, they must have spent the time looking for him.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
When you were looking at the question sheet, did it seem like she had gotten through most of it?
Most of it.
Oh, okay.
Really?
Most of it.
That's good.
Have we covered all of the information you were provided that would be relevant?
Or do we need to...
Let me double check that.
Yeah, yeah.
I believe so.
Okay.
Okay, good.
Okay.
Okay.
It's the weather's nice.
Gorgeous, yeah.
Except it's cold.
I know.
We were in the sun to start, but...
Yeah.
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Remember, I spend more time with him than you do, and I have from the very beginning.
And you're a good listener.
And reader.
I talked to your husband.
Oh, you did?
No, I need to.
By all means.
Yeah.
So you didn't recognize that sneaker, that shoe?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
And as I said, since I can't physically search like you can, I'm glad that I can at least make me feel that I'm part of what's going on and that I am helping.
That's very important. And this is why I can't do the physical.
Yeah. I'm leaving the doctor's office and he says, aren't you going to ask me? I said, ask you for what? I said, a handicap sticker. I said, I didn't know I qualified. He said, oh yeah, you do.
Oh, wow.
So, I always assumed doctors were kind of tight on this. I thought so too, yeah. That shows what shape I'm in. Oh. Yeah. I get around. Yeah. You manage the best you can. I always say it could be a thousand times worse and I'm hoping it doesn't get better.
I had it for quite a few years. It's, um, and it even works in France. Oh, wow. We were visiting some friends. This was quite a few years ago and there was no parking at the chateau. And I said, oh, there's a handicap spot. Oh. And he said, yep.
Wow. Do you have to get them renewed or is it? It's automatic. Oh my gosh. That's nice. Every two years. Yeah. Wow. I had a temporary one for a bit and that had to be renewed. But when the doctor said, no, I'm just authentic. Wow.
Yeah. When did this one expire? Yeah. Sure. Anyway. Um.
What time did they start the search?
Well, the Hasty crew was here at 730, but they didn't probably start searching until maybe 8, as far as I can tell.
Yeah. We were here at 6.
Really? Wow. Wow.
I'm sorry. 630. 630. Still? Still. 630. Yeah.
Was the sun up? No. Okay. Um.
Yeah.
We didn't get back until after midnight last night. We were in Jadix and Tisle with our granddaughter in the room. So our plane was delayed. She didn't get out of school on time. Our first plane was delayed. So we had to go for a second plane. That one got delayed. Wow. So we didn't get back until we had a lot of sleep.
Hopefully you had coffee if you drank coffee.
That's something I can't do. Oh. Well, good for you.
Chamomile tea. Oh, cool.
Yeah. How about this afternoon? Yeah. More like it. More like it. Yeah, it sounds good.
But we brought her back.
Aw.
How old is she?
Thirteen.
She said to me, I know I could fly alone, but I love traveling with you.
Oh, my gosh. That's lovely. Yeah.
Well, grandchildren are your reward for not murdering your own children.
See, I can see that.
Yeah.
That's so funny.
So funny.
I've been on the team just about two years.
Yeah.
Maybe a little under.
What's your connection?
My husband.
Oh.
Who?
John Callen.
Oh.
Oh.
No wonder you were here so early.
Did he, to set up and stuff?
Like, or did they have the role players come that early?
Or you just came with him?
I don't know. I came with him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we, as we came, the, uh.
Oh, trucks were rolling in.
Oh, okay.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
And how about you?
Are you on the search and rescue?
Yeah, I was.
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I was on the team.
Oh, nice.
Not anymore.
Cool.
Still.
Volunteering to be a subject.
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was really nice to meet us.
Yeah, really nice.
That's it.
Yeah.
A way to stay involved.
It's such a great organization.
Yeah.
I have a lot of friends.
Oh.
that I still stay in contact with from Search and Rescue, so I kind of know what's going
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I kind of mentioned at one of our get-togethers that, you know, hey, you guys ever need any
volunteer subjects?
Sure.
Yeah.
They're vocal.
That's great.
Perfect.
Yeah.
That works.
There was a time.
I know it's being recorded.
Yeah.
There was a time years ago, BC, before COVID.
But we got a...
Jonathan was called out in a search up north.
It was a recovery.
Mm-hmm.
And so he left.
And about 15 minutes later, I get a phone call from our daughter.
And she's all upset.
Where's Dad?
I said, he's not home.
I need him.
You have to call him back right away.
I said, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My next-door neighbor who has Alzheimer's has disappeared.
So I quick called Jonathan.
Oh, my God.
And he says, I know why you're calling, and I can't talk now.
So what they did is they split the team.
Half the team went north to do the recovery.
Oh, and half the team went south.
Oh.
And looked for the walkaway.
Look for the daughter's next-door neighbor.
Oh, my gosh.
And they found her as she was walking onto the freeway, and they saved her life.
Oh, my gosh.
Wow.
Wow.
And my daughter called me later and said, oh, my gosh.
Dad walked in in his uniform, and, you know, had people doing things and everything.
I was special.
I had never seen him like that.
Oh, my gosh.
That's great.
I was very proud of her.
Yeah.
Very, very proud of her.
Yeah.
That's awesome.
And a couple years later, she went missing again.
My daughter had moved somewhere else, but this particular lady, her name was Luba, went missing again, and she was missing for three days.
Wow.
And they did find her alive.
A lot?
Oh, my gosh.
That's incredible.
Very.
Yikes.
That, actually, that's her to make TV.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
That is kind of a long time to...
And then it was, you know, still a rescue.
No, it was...
Not a recovery.
It was a...
Right, exactly.
Yeah, that's amazing.
Exactly.
Yeah.
I know.
I'm so curious.
What's...
Go ahead.
No, no, I don't...
I'll stay here.
I'll make sure.
I have been instructed to...
I don't know what to do with it.
...keep you guys here.
Part of the training, don't lose your...
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
Ashley, don't laugh, because, as you said, you were tempted to...
Yeah.
Well, and it took a long time for you to get here.
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
That's a big reason.
Yeah, some of the trainings that I was involved in, that was part of the thing.
It's like, okay, you just duck away.
Yeah.
Oh.
And then it's like, hey, where did they go?
You know?
Right, right.
It's part of the...
You know, you...
Yep.
You keep an eye on us.
Yeah.
Or that one of you would be so distraught, it would be a distraction...
Right.
...to getting, like, information or taking care, attending to X, Y, or Z.
And I think those are very realistic.
Yep.
There's a lot of emotions flying around with your loved ones.
Oh, yeah.
There's a lot of...
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember one of the things that they say at training is that, you know, for the medical
training, that you'll be doing more medical training in real life than actually...
Oh, on a mission.
...than on a search.
Yeah.
No, than on a search.
Oh, interesting.
And that has happened virtually numerous times.
Wow.
On planes.
Oh, my gosh.
Anybody with any medical training.
Oh, wow.
The doctors don't like to raise their hand.
My husband raises his hand.
Well, raise his hand.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Good for him.
Yeah.
Jeez.
Driving down the street.
Bicycleist got run over.
Car accident.
Mm.
To charge.
Oh, nice.
Wow.
Yeah.
My job is always to call 911.
That's a good job.
And on the planes, go for the oxygen.
Ah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oxygen only.
Right.
Exactly.
It's available.
They drill that into our heads for sure.
Yeah.
It's there.
Use it.
Mm-hmm.
It's like the wonder drug, apparently.
Yeah.
It's the one thing.
It can't hurt.
It might help.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It can't hurt.
It's in his life.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I've learned a lot from him.
Oh, I bet.
I bet.
Yeah.
He's a resource officer, too.
I see part of that.
One of the law enforcement.
Does he carry a gun?
No.
No, no.
He's not part of that.
No.
Our son is...
Mm-hmm.
Does all kinds of training and executive protection.
He's an EMT.
Oh.
And he does executive protection.
There's an animal medical all over the place in your family.
That's handy.
I thought I could remember.
There's certain people on the team that are resource officers that work for different departments.
Mm-hmm.
One of those guys.
His background in training is market research, so he checks and researches.
It's good to have one of those in the family.
Yeah, he worked for little companies like Visa, Clorox, DeLax.
Those little old things.
Hello, Steve and Debra.
Hello.
I hope your meeting went well.
Yeah, it's all educational, so I thought it was kind of interesting because you're off script.
They're giving us tips on this is what you should be doing, which was kind of interesting in terms of operations and stuff.
Steve, do we have the name of Liam's doctor and where he's at, he or she is at?
Kaiser.
Doctor.
Is it Shadlin's or over at the...
Do you know the doctor's name?
Smith.
Dr. Smith.
A male or female?
A female.
Okay.
Do you have the...
Lori, Lori, Lori, Lori, Lori Smith.
Lori Smith.
L-A-U-R-I-E.
Sure.
Do you have her phone number?
Do you have her contact for her office?
No.
Is it like 925-555-1212?
That's where the case is.
Yeah, that's it.
1-2-1-2?
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, we're going to want to reach out to her and just talk to her about the medical condition, the diabetes, and see what are the adverse effects.
I know, Debra, you gave us some really great information, and that's sort of a slow, tapered process.
But we just want to make sure there isn't anything in terms of coming from a clinical standpoint that, you know, might jeopardize even further his condition currently.
I think that's a good idea.
So, let's see.
Can you let Ops know?
It's Dr. Lori Smith out of Shade Lungs in 95-55-1212.
Like, literally let them know?
Yeah.
Okay.
Or let them know.
Yeah, exactly.
It was so warm in there, and I was all ready to, like, I have this warming vest, which is great, because it fits under the star jacket, and it's all battery-operated, but now I'm in the shade, and I'm freezing cold.
Tell me about it.
My wife has one of those.
Does she have the liner one?
I love it, because it fits right under.
Yeah.
It's just a vest.
It's like almost like a down vest.
Yeah.
I have a couple of the...
I'm a big RO fan.
I have the vests, and I have a couple jackets, and now I have this thing, which is great, because I can use it for this stuff.
All right, back on script.
And then you just do this.
And the newer ones apparently take two batteries.
So I don't need it.
Okay.
Put it in medium mode.
It can.
Yeah.
Really?
It can charge your phone.
You just got to have the cable and stuff.
All right.
I don't know.
I don't know.
No new information from...
So I do get to...
I got to see the search pattern, and our teams are really out there making a lot of headway, a lot of coverage.
And we have something like 18 teams out there right now.
18.
18.
18.
So we're really covering...
That's a deal.
Oops.
Oh, rats.
I just cut them off.
Is it Steve calling?
Hello?
It's my wife.
Hello?
Is that Liam by any chance?
No.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Did you guys send someone to my...
Did you guys send someone to my house?
That I don't know.
I believe the police went over, though.
From what I understand.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Love you.
Bye.
Hey, Deborah.
Who was that, if I can ask?
That was...
That was just one of my neighbors.
Oh, okay.
Is everything okay, or did they have anything to report?
They had nothing to report.
What?
Nothing to report?
Nothing to report.
Nothing?
No, they...
I...
As I was leaving, I saw them tonight.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to say hello to this old timer.
Nice to see you, buddy.
Walter.
Thanks for coming out today.
Thanks for having me, man.
Check in later.
Thanks again.
All right.
You know, I did take Liam a couple of days ago for a chocolate to Noah's for a chocolate
chip bagel, and he just loves those.
He goes nuts over those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did the neighbor have anything to say about the chocolate chip bagel?
No, no, no, no.
Okay.
Can we confirm whether or not they went the...
They searched over at the bagel place?
Okay.
They were going to, but I'll confirm.
Yeah.
But off script for a minute.
Yeah.
I was asked if you guys have any information in your background info to call a doctor.
Like, is there someone who's role-playing a doctor, or did you get any more information
about the medication and the effects of...
Okay.
So...
The questions were asked, yes.
No, but it did...
So she wanted to know, is there a role-player who's playing the doctor that we can actually
call?
Like, pretend to call.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And then, um...
Yeah, let's double check on that.
Make sure that they have searched the...
Bagel place?
Yeah.
Okay.
That it's come up again.
Okay.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
So that I'm going to...
So it seems like it's an important spot for him to make sure that they have searched...
Yeah, I've taken him...
Because it is across the street.
It's just across the street.
It isn't across the street.
It's actually down...
In Countrywood Shopping Center.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's not that far.
It's not that far.
It's a couple blocks away.
Right?
Sort of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He could definitely...
Yeah, he's got a bicycle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He could get there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, um...
I'll definitely go do that.
But they wanted some more information about how long...
If he hasn't had this medication, how long would it take for him to just be completely withdrawn?
I know we said it was like one to two hours before he starts feeling the effects.
But do we have any information about how long it would take for him to just kind of crash out and...
Has that ever happened?
Where he crashed out?
Where he didn't take his medication and then it became so...
It was slowly.
It was slowly.
It was slowly.
It was slowly.
I think once at school.
Uh-huh.
And they noticed, you know, they...
We told the school in advance that, you know, he was...
And that he needed his insulin to make sure that he did it.
Once at school where he was kind of doing this, getting kind of non-responsive.
And do we have any idea how long...
It was...
Like what time of day that happened?
Okay.
So he took his insulin at...
He didn't take it at breakfast that day.
Okay.
And it was at lunchtime and he started doing this.
Okay.
Okay.
So like around 11.30 or something?
Around 12 o'clock.
12 o'clock.
Okay.
So 12 o'clock he would be completely catatom.
Okay.
Thank you.
But the thing is...
And you said his dosage is at 7?
It would have been at 7.
Between 7 and 7.30 the night before.
So at 7.30 though he takes it in the morning?
Okay.
So he missed that one.
So he would have had it...
I'm sorry.
So they had like 6 o'clock or 6.30.
6 o'clock.
So that was the last time he took his medicine.
He would last until noon today-ish.
If he had taken the medicine.
If he had...
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
He had taken the breakfast one.
But I think they have in there that he should have taken it at 6.30.
And Debra is saying 7.30.
Are we talking about breakfast or dinner?
Sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
Breakfast.
Breakfast.
And we also don't know if he had...
I thought dinner was 6.30.
If he had enough food to eat.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I...
They...
What time did the sleepover start?
Do you know what time it started?
Time to...
Did he have dinner before leaving or at the...
I talked to Moffitt about...
It was probably about 5 o'clock.
5.
Did he have dinner beforehand?
They had...
They had stuff there.
Oh, yeah.
They had stuff there.
Okay.
Yeah.
So...
At least he...
You know he had the dinner.
Okay.
So it would be...
And then also, if we could find out whether or not Sophia is interviewable...
Interviewable?
The friend?
Mm-hmm.
She was away this morning, but we really wanted to find out if she's available.
That's important.
Okay.
Thank you, Wendy.
Y'all are done by the time I came back?
What's that?
Are you done by the time you came back?
I think we're done like 20 minutes.
No, just kidding.
I got the doctor's information.
Or I should say I inputted, created the doctor's information.
Sounds good.
What I like about these mock searches and scenarios is that there's all this stuff that can come out of that you don't think of when you're putting it together.
Like, oh, wait a minute.
That's right.
Yeah.
I really like that chocolate chip bagel.
Ah, ah, ah.
Is that a wink, wink, wink?
That was something I said earlier on.
Get searched over.
That was bagels.
Yes.
You did say that.
Yeah.
I hope they sent somebody over there.
Didn't I say that early on?
Absolutely.
Okay.
And you said the blanket, the baby blanket too.
You asked me if he had a favorite food or anything like that.
Yeah.
And so we talked about it, yes.
And he did make a note on it.
Did you hear that, Chris Young?
That was a while ago that the chocolate chip bagel came up.
That does sound really good.
That does sound really good right now with some cream cheese on it.
Yeah.
The chocolate chip and the cream cheese combination.
That would be really good.
That would be really good.
You guys up with bagels and coffee?
You want me to call for it?
Yeah.
Would you?
You want to call for some bagels and coffee?
You want to get on your bike and go pick it up?
Yeah.
Steve, I'll let you go for that.
I already searched that area.
Oh, okay.
Oh, you already searched Noah's bagels?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you did?
This morning.
Oh, this morning.
Okay.
You did a search?
Yeah.
Okay.
So I was hanging out with a cup of coffee.
I gotcha.
That makes sense.
Do you have your bike here with you?
Yeah.
What kind of bike is it?
It's not a special bike.
Is it a regular bike, though, or an e-bike?
Okay.
Yeah.
I was just looking at e-bikes yesterday because I had a Rad.
And I bought it used and then I sold it because it was a folding one.
I thought, oh, I can load in the car.
And I could, but they're so clunky and they're really uncomfortable to ride.
Geometry on those things.
So I'm looking at an e-bike that's a regular bike.
But they're all built like motorcycles.
And I already have one of those, sort of.
Oh, oh.
You are cool.
That's a e-bike.
Do some research because I have an e-bike, too.
What do you have?
It's called a Bulls, B-U-L-L-S.
It's a mountain bike.
Okay.
But there are so many options now.
Yeah.
They're comfortable and lighter.
So there are some basic.
You just like doing.
No, I already know I want a class three.
And I'm looking at the Velo Trek.
Yeah.
Do you belong to, like, a bike team or bike?
Oh, the bike team here.
Nah.
Or do you bike regularly with the group?
I used to be a pretty hardcore cyclist, but rode.
And when e-bikes kind of came on the scene, I was sort of poo-pooing the e-bike.
And now that my knees are older, I'm like, oh, yeah, the e-bike would be really nice to have.
The reason I'm asking, we have a friend who is not a professional biker, but he's part of a team.
And he's biked all over the world.
And he's done all the research into the bike.
There was a request earlier that whether or not we could interview Sophia and they never heard back.
So they're going to renew that request to find out.
Yeah.
Because we do have her number.
And then what about, did they say anything about Noah's?
They were confirming whether or not it had been checked.
They were now putting it on the map, like, indicating where it was on the map.
But I don't know that they didn't search it, but they're going to renew that effort.
Okay, good.
Yeah.
They should, because it's a key point of interest for him.
Yeah.
And are we on or off the record?
Oh, now I'm going back on the record for, like, two seconds.
Okay, because I had a question.
Off the record.
Oh, okay.
So we can confirm this is Liam here.
That's Liam and his bike.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It looks like it.
Yeah.
Okay, perfect.
I don't know.
Somebody posted it.
Somebody posted it?
Oh, that's fine.
A recent posting?
I mean, like, now?
They want to know if it's a sighting, I think.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That was my question.
You read my mind.
Yeah, okay, good.
No, I think it's...
Somebody searched.
I think it's...
It looks like it's a descriptive picture, so just confirming that's him and the bike.
Somehow they're holding that button.
Yeah.
Whoever posted it.
The dad provided it, but he doesn't remember.
No.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
6.30 this morning.
It was, yeah.
And interestingly, it is a picture of him at Heather Farms.
So it's like...
I don't know who you're hearing.
Any littles around?
Yeah.
No, he looks like he's all by himself in the parking lot in that picture.
It does look like it was taken about three seconds ago, though.
Right?
He's taking pictures of himself.
He doesn't have a phone.
That's funny.
That's funny.
I'm assuming that you don't know the answer to this question, but when you drop... at camp,
I assume that the camp, the people running the camp take his medication and they're the ones who give it to him at the appropriate time.
So he wouldn't have had it in his backpack.
Okay.
I heard on the radio that he...
He doesn't have his backpack?
Earlier, they were confirmed he didn't have his medication with him.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
That's where I was.
Okay.
Just for the canal.
Just the canal.
Oh.
So, uh, Steve and, um, Barbara...
Deborah?
Sorry.
Barbara.
Bad interviewer.
That was like...
Um, is there anything else you can think of, um, that would assist with creating this, uh, image and profile of Liam?
Like, anything, anything characteristic-wise, with personality?
No.
Again, it's just the...
It's the diet.
It's the blood sugar that's really...
Mm-hmm.
So we're concerned.
Every minute that goes by is another minute.
Okay.
Yeah.
Would he know to seek out that bagel or something?
Maybe ask somebody for help or would he do that?
I wouldn't ask anybody for help.
Because that's one of the things...
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't like strangers.
He doesn't like strangers.
Doesn't feel comfortable.
Yeah.
Um, if he were hungry or whatever, um, and he has great memories of the two of us going to the bagel shop, um, he might.
Okay.
He might.
Would he be...
He feel comfortable?
So he doesn't have any monetary, uh, means.
Would he be comfortable going in and asking them for a bagel?
Well...
Does he love it that much that he would do that?
As you said, he...
He...
He isn't concerned with money.
That's not...
Ah, so he wouldn't even necessarily know that he would need it.
He might just walk in and order a bagel?
When I take them in, not a bagel.
Yeah.
I pay for it.
Oh, yeah.
Um, so...
And you take them.
You pay for it.
So...
When we do things, we pay for it.
So it's not...
It's not a consideration.
So the concept of having to pay for something to get goods is not there.
So he would just go in and order, like if he was with you.
Yeah, he goes in first.
He orders and I pay.
Okay.
Magic.
Yeah.
I need a Nana.
We all need a Nana.
Do you guys have any more questions for me?
Um, I...
Right now, um...
You know, I feel like there might be some questions that are going to come up.
Would you object if I, um...
See what's going on with the rest of the management team to kind of check in and see what, uh...
Maybe there's some information they can share.
If they're comfortable with it.
Yeah, what kind of questions might you have?
Because maybe we can actually find them out for you and kind of get it a little more concise.
Well, you had mentioned a search area and a monitor with tracks and stuff.
I might be able to assist if I saw where you've been and where I've been with them.
Yeah, yeah, so...
Where's Grandma's taking them and that type of thing.
Wendy, let's, uh, go, uh, find ops and ask them if it is okay if, uh, Steve could...
Mm-hmm.
You know, look at the search area map.
Okay.
And if he could possibly offer some insight into it.
Um, because obviously it's a really tight quarters around there.
Mm-hmm.
So we don't want to, um, you know, we don't want you getting hurt with people moving around a lot.
So just, uh, see if it's okay.
Okay.
All right.
Um, if not, we'll try to, you know, explain as best as we can for you.
Relay that information.
I just said a couple of months.
Um, so off-grid, we do have some potential candidates for the next academy coming around.
So they're probably going to come over here.
So I'm just going to talk to people about what's going on.
So if you want to, like, should we get some eye drops?
Get you all teary?
Rub those cheeks?
Make you all red?
Just get you with the form.
Let's start over.
Maybe we'll start challenging the interviewer.
No.
Oh, no.
I'll be like this.
Exactly.
Damn.
I'm not religious about anything.
Let me start for this.
Oh, no.
Exactly.
I'm going to stop this for a while.
