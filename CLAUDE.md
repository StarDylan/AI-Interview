I am working on a project for a Search and Rescue team, here is the abstract:
In Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, time pressure and inexperience can lead to missed opportunities during interviews with a missing person’s friends and family. This thesis presents a real-time, end-to-end system that suggests context-aware follow-up questions and extracts actionable clues as the interview unfolds. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), agentic design patterns, and integration with the IntelliSAR platform, the system assists interviewers in surfacing more complete and relevant information. It also compiles key insights into a structured clue log, ready for human review, refinement, and dissemination to the rest of the team. The system’s ultimate goal is to accelerate clue discovery and reduce the likelihood of critical information being overlooked in time-sensitive SAR missions.

I am using this techstack: LangGraph/LangChain, Python, Langfuse, WebRTC, Vite, Pydantic, Typescript.
