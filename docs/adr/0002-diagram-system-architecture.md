# 2. Diagram System Architecture

Date: 2025-08-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

After trying several times to start this project, it is clear that I need to think of an architecture before I start coding. I have tried to diagram the architecture with a whiteboard, but it just turns into a mess of boxes and lines and I wasn't able to effectively diagram it.

## Decision

In order to help brainstorm, visualize and communicate the architecture, I have decided to use the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) with Structurizr.

## Consequences

This provides a structured way to represent my thoughts and ultimate architecture decisions visually. Which will make it easier to make a structure and stick to it and communicate with myself (between coding sessions) and stakeholders.

The only downside is that I am using a new language called Structurizr DSL to do this. But it is not too complex and pretty self-explainatory. It will also help with the speed of diagramming.

Potentially we can also develop a CI to auto-build these diagrams for display on the Github repo.
